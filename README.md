## Description

- Our team needed to program the WLKATA robotic arm to complete 3 small pick-and-place missions
- To solve the problem:
  - First, we taught the robot to move all the objects from the initial to the final position for each task as marked on the A4 map.
  - Then the G code for all the operations could be extracted by using Teaching mode of WLKATA Studio.
  - Using the G code, we could develop a Python program that controls the robot to do the same tasks without having to teach it again.
- Our team incorporated several different coding techniques, such as looping and conditional statements, so that the same code could be used for all 3 missions without having to rewrite it.
- The intended action then can be saved as a command allowing the user to program the robot.
 
## Result

- Demonstration video for Task 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4g7oYp-iQg
- Demonstration video for Task 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwAInWuEkW4
- Demonstration video for Task 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ams2OOUbd_4

- According to the demo video above, the system has successfully managed to control the robot arm to perform some interactions with the cube by exploring the structure and parameters of the WKLATA Mirobot. The robotic project helps shed light on the industry requirements for robotic manufacturing as well as some programming languages such as G-code and Python.
